We create [GUIDES](https://github.com/micromodules/guides/) how to build libraries in any programming language. Also see [PROJECTS](https://github.com/micromodules/meetup/blob/master/PROJECTS.md) for a list of libraries we've been working on. The next meetup is planned on [MEETUP.COM](http://www.meetup.com/More-Micro-Modules). And finally, there are some random [NOTES](https://github.com/micromodules/meetup/blob/master/NOTES.md) from previous meetups.
